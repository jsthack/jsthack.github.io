Thanks for joining me here at the <b>JustHack Blog.</b> I'm excited to be blogging again, I find it extremely helpful to write about things your learning or working on. I see this blog having two main purposes. A place for me to archive things I'm working on, and a place where I share <b>web technologies, tools, articles,</b> and more from the <b>Web Dev / UI & UX world.</b>

If you ever have a question or just want to say hi feel free to ping me on <b>[Twitter](http://twitter.com/cosmin_haims),</b> or you can shoot me an email. <b>[Here](http://cossmin.com/#/contact/)</b>
